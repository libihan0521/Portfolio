           Feeding your emotions to the Bunny—who then poops them into Emo-Chocolate, the game’s currency—marks the start of the game loop. This playful process draws on psychological concepts like emotional externalization and symbolic expression: by turning inner feelings into tangible, humorous elements, players are encouraged to acknowledge, accept, and express their emotions in a non-judgmental way.

            <h2>4 bunny foods</h2>
            <p>
              Four types of bunny food were introduced in the final design: emo-ball, emo-soup, emo-salad, and emo-burger. They cater to different logging habits, facilitating diverse perspectives in analyzing and understanding emotions.

            <h2>When you forget to feed</h2>
            <p>
              Your bunny needs to eat daily to go out and play. Eating more food increases the chance of finding emotional fragments. If you forget to feed your bunny for more than three days, it goes into a dormant state. Feeding it for three consecutive days will reactivate it, but don't worry, the bunny won't die. Ensuring a positive and uplifting experience is important in my game.

            <h2>Raw food materials</h2>
            <p>
              Some food items have a numbered display representing raw materials. If you run out, you can't make that food unless you purchase materials from the shop using in-game currency. Emo-ball is an exception and doesn't require raw materials. Raw food materials serve two purposes:  
              </br></br>
              1. Accommodates different recording preferences of players. Unlocking different feeding panels through the purchase of raw food materials allows players with specific recording habits to choose the method that suits them best.
              </br></br>
              2. Serve as consumable items, preventing the game loop from being disrupted. If there were no consumable items and players had already purchased all available items from the shop, collecting emo-chocolates would become pointless. The inclusion of raw food materials maintains the game's flow.
            </br></br>
              The current version includes 3 types of raw food materials, with the potential for more varieties in future updates.

            Emo-Chocolate can then be used to purchase props that influence the Bunny’s behavior. 
          </br></br>Psychologically, this represents a symbolic form of emotion regulation—transforming emotions into energy that enables action and change. It helps players manage internal states and fosters emotional agency.
           </br></br>From a game design perspective, this forms a classic “Input → Resource → Influence” loop. The feedback cycle encourages ongoing emotional engagement, driving both gameplay progression and emotional insight.

            “Emotional Fragments” are short comics showing how the Bunny feels in certain moments. These feelings are common to everyone, but often so subtle that they’re easily missed. By discovering them, players become more emotionally aware. The stories are meant to be funny and enjoyable, encouraging players to keep collecting and playing.

          Below is the example comic content I created for the game's prototype.

        <h2>Theory foundation: The power of Emotional Agility </h2>
        <p>Renowned scholar Susan David, known for her work in emotion theory, coined the term "Emotional Agility." </p>
        <p>In her talk, she explores the transformative strategies of emotional agility, which involves understanding, accepting, and practicing self-care to our emotions. She also delves into how improving emotional agility benefits our actions, careers, relationships, health, and overall well-being. </p>
        <p>Susan David’s research provides a theoretical endorsement for the value of "Bunny Mood".</p>

        <h2>Initial Ideation: Why emotion journaling + gaming?</h2>
        <p>My initial design prompt is <span class="bold">"Design SOMETHING for East Asian youth to improve their 'Emotional Agility'." </span></p>
        <p>But I am not sure what on earth is <span class="bold">"SOMETHING"</span>. </p>
        <p>Therefore, I prototyped some ideas, and gain critique through testing, presentations, workshop, peer review, and expert review to clarify my design prompt in the begining.</p>

        <p>Bunny Mood's most direct competitors are those emotion journaling applications.</p>
        <img src="../images/BunnyMood/Direct Competitive Products.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p>However, since Bunny Mood falls into the overlapping domains of casual gaming, Social-emotional learning (SEL), and digital therapeutics (healthcare) industry, there are some products that offer similar experiences or functionalities.</p>
