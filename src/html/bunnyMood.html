        <h2>Reviews on Apple Store</h2>
        <p>Utilizing reviews on the Apple Store provides an additional avenue for user research. 
          In order to gather insights into users' perceptions regarding specific features and experiences, 
          I conducted an analysis of their attitudes using a card-sorting panel based on these collected reviews.</p>

        <p class="keyword">Feedback delay is the top reason why users quit an emotion journal product.</p>
        <p>The <span class="bold">primary positive feedback</span> received in emotion tracking is <span class="bold">when users revisit their old journals</span>, 
          triggering nostalgic memories or discovering patterns within their emotions.</p>
        <p>However, the time required to accumulate a sufficient number of journals to attain such positive 
          feedback is often <span class="bold">lengthy</span>. Additionally, <span class="bold">the process of journaling itself can be draining</span> for 
          many individuals. If they miss a week of recording, it often leads to a longer gap of a month, 
          eventually resulting in abandonment. Thus, establishing the habit of consistent journaling 
          becomes a significant challenge. <span class="bold">The primary reason users discontinue using an emotion journal 
          product is due to the delay in receiving feedback.</span></p>

        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <h3>Primary persona</h3>
        <p>Based on the research findings, I have chosen young individuals, approximately 14 to 25 years old, as my primary target audience. These individuals have little to no experience with emotion-tracking software, lack social-emotional learning, and may be facing emotional challenges. My decision to focus on this group is not solely driven by rational analysis or profit-seeking motives. Instead, it stems from a genuine desire to empower them. I want to provide them with a tool that offers solace in their emotions and helps establish a strong psychological foundation for their future. I aim to share the transformative experience I had when I began caring about my own emotions. Although their initial attraction may be the game's entertainment value, they will ultimately experience personal growth through the engaging elements.</p>
        <img src="../images/BunnyMood/Persona1.png" style="width:100%;">
        </br>
        <h3>Secondary persona</h3>
        <p>The secondary personas consist of individuals who are already using or have used emotion-tracking software but are seeking a superior tool. These secondary users can be further categorized based on their emotional tracking goals:</p>
        <p>1. Those who rely on such products to maintain their mental well-being.</p> 
        <img src="../images/BunnyMood/Persona2.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p>2. Those who use them for personal growth and memory preservation.</p>
        <img src="../images/BunnyMood/Persona3.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p>You may have noticed that all three personas are Chinese. This is because I wanted to have a specific cultural background to guide the creation of game content. Additionally, as someone with firsthand experience of the emotional suppression and neglect in Chinese society as an East Asian community, I want to chose China as the cultural backdrop of this project.</p>

        <p>Reaching the final design of "Bunny Mood" wasn't an immediate process. 
        Honestly, I even didn't reach a clear design goal like "creating a game for logging emotions" 
        initially.  Instead, I set out with the obscure design goal of "designing something for people 
        to better understand their emotions". It was after a series of brainstorming, testing, 
        and iterations that I finally arrived at the design of "Bunny Mood".

        <div class="twoColumn">
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
           <p>I introduced four types of bunny food in the final design: emo-ball, emo-soup, emo-salad, and emo-burger, catering to different users' logging habits and helping to analyze and understand emotions from various perspectives.</p>
           <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0001.gif" style="width:100%;">
          </div>
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
            <p>
              The emo-ball is the most convenient option for creating food. You can record your emotions by drawing expressive visuals and providing accompanying text descriptions.   
              </br>&nbsp
            </p>
            <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0002.gif" style="width:100%;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="twoColumn">
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
           <p>Emo-soup enables the understanding of granularity and complexity. When preparing an emo-soup, you can assign a name to your current emotion and select the fundamental emotions that make up the mixed feeling.</p>
           <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0003.gif" style="width:100%;">
          </div>
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
            <p>
              In an emo-burger, you can upload media files such as sound, photos, and videos to record your emotions. This feature allows you to capture and preserve your current emotions more vividly.   
            </p>
            <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0004.gif" style="width:100%;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="twoColumn">
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
           <p>
             Emo-salad encourages you to analyze your emotions from a non-judgmental perspective, in which you can name your emotions and choose relevant tags. The tag selection helps you explore the underlying causes of emotional challenges you may be facing, facilitating problem-solving and the development of effective strategies. This process aligning with techniques commonly used by therapists and social emotional learning educators to enhance emotional skills.
           </p> 
           <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0005.gif" style="width:100%;">
          </div>
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
            <p>
              You may have noticed that some food items display a number. This represents the number of raw food materials. If you run out of a type of raw food materials, you are unable to make this food, like we are unable to make emo-burger in the following mockup. But we can purchase some emo-burger materials from the shop, using Bunny poops, the in-game currency. Emo-ball is an exception as it is the simplest food that doesn't require raw food materials to produce.    
            </p>
            <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0006.gif" style="width:100%;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The inclusion of raw food materials serves two purposes:</p>
        <p>Firstly, it accommodates different recording preferences of players. By unlocking different feeding panels through the purchasing of various raw food materials, players with specific recording habits won't feel redundant, allowing each player to choose the method that suits them best.</p>
        <p>Secondly, raw food materials serve as consumable items. If there were no consumable items and players had already purchased all available items from the shop, collecting emo-chocolates would become pointless, disrupting the game loop. The inclusion of raw food materials overcomes this issue and maintains the game's flow.</p>
        <p>In the current version, I've designed four types of bunny food, but the interface layout allows for the potential addition of more food varieties in future updates.</p>
        <p>Your bunny will only go out to play if it has eaten the food for the day. The more food it eats, the greater the possibility of bringing back emotional fragments. If you forget to feed your bunny for more than three days, the bunny will go into a dormant state. You will need to feed it for three consecutive days to resume its activity but rest assured, it won't die. It would be too harsh if the bunny could die, and I want to ensure that players don't feel saddened in my game.</br>&nbsp</br>&nbsp</p>
        <h3>Purchase and place items to influence the bunny's activities </h3>
        <div class="twoColumn">
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
           <p></br>&nbsp</br>Besides raw food materials, players can utilize emo-chocolates to purchase items in the other three categories: articles, clothes, and furniture. 
             </br>&nbsp
             </br>&nbsp
           </p>
           <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0007.gif" style="width:100%;">
          </div>
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
            <p>Players can purchase different clothes to dress up their bunnies. These clothes will influence the locations where the bunnies go. For example, if the bunny is dressed in a swimsuit, it may bring back an emotion fragment that occurred at the swimming pool. This design not only adds depth and enjoyment to the gameplay but also allows players to customize the appearance of their bunnies. </p>
            <img  src="../images/BunnyMood/Rec-0008.gif" style="width:100%;">

        </div>
        <div class="twoColumn">
          <div class="twoColumChild" style="padding:2vw">
           <p>Articles will influence the bunny's activity depicted in the emotion fragment. For example, giving bunny a ticket may let it bring you a emotion fragment in with it is holding the ticket to take a train.</p>

           <p>Displaying all of the features on the main page might make players who prefer minimalist functions feel overwhelmed. To address this, extra features are integrated into different pieces of furniture. This not only allows players to customize the features but also enriches the shopping experience. It also facilitates the future addition of new features during game operation.

            <p>Here are some examples of furniture:</br>
              Code case: Reserve food for a specific bunny visitor.</br>
              Magic box: Sell items</br>
              Potty: Automatically collect emo-chocolate.</br>
              Board: Check feeding records.</br>
              ...</br>
              You can place a furniture on the room, and tap it to use its functions. The game incoporates AR so the room would be your real environment.</p>
