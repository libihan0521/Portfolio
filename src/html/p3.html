       <p>Frequent mirror checking is an important signal of appearance anxiety. 
        I have read a report that the teenager would check the mirror about 30 times a day, 
        while old people only have an average of 6 times daily mirror-checking behaviors. 
        I think 30 is such a big number, so I want to test whether I follow this pattern. 
        Then I tracked my mirror gazing behavior for 7 days, clicking different colors of squares to filter with the type 
        of mirrors and clicking circles with different diameters to filter with the duration of mirror-checking. 
       </p>
       <h2>Reflection</h2>
       <h3>What I have learned about myself through the process of self-tracking</h3>
       <p>
        On the sixth day, my mirror checking times are much more than those of the rest days. 
        Because on the third day, I wore makeup and did not wear a mask, while on the other five days, I did. 
        So I learned that wearing a mask can reduce my attention to my appearance. since human attention is a limited resource. 
        So if I have challenging works to do on one day, maybe I could try to wear a mask on that day to spare my attention.
       </p>
       <h3>What was gained/lost through the process of data visualization</h3>
       <p>I use colors to differentiate the types of mirrors. I do not want to make the color too complicated, 
        so I  merged all the mirrors I have used into four types. Some information is omitted here, for example,  
        I just classified the building's outside surface, the metal surface in a subway station, the spoons, and the car windows 
        all as the reflector. But I have recorded the detailed information in the initial spreadsheet.
